        <p>What are you waiting for? Let's make one. It's a perfect weeknight meal.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="title align-left">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Steak of your choice</li>
        <li>Sprinkle of Salt</li>
        <li>2 to 3 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1-inch knob of Ginger</li>
        <li>Thai Chili Flake or Cayenne Powder</li>
        <li>Say sauce or Maggi seasoning</li>
        <li>15 g Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>1 head of Broccoli</li>
        <li>Splash of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="title align-left">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>(Optional) Place the steak in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours before cooking. Cook rice to serve it with.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the steak as thin as possible and toss it into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Using a grater, grate the garlic cloves and ginger. Add to the bowl along with the chili flake, a pour of soy sauce, and half of the vegetable oil. Mix together with your hands.</li>
        <li>Chop the broccoli into pieces for stir-frying.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining oil into a wok and set over high heat. Once just starting to smoke, add the seasoned beef and stir fry for 1-2 minutes until cooked through. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add a little soy sauce and water to the wok. Scrape the fond from the bottom of the pan and then add the broccoli. Let cook until the water evaporates, then set aside. The broccoli should still be a bit crunchy.</li>
        <li>To serve, place rice down along a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Add the broccoli followed by the beef, some pickled onions and lastly another sprinkle of the chili flakes. Devour.</li>
    </ol>
